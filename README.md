## Slack CS699 Project
﻿Web application much like **Slack**.
**Slack** is a tool that allows multi person teams (geographically spread) to coordinate over projects. At the core, Slack is a messaging system where users can send messages that are received instantaneously by others.

multiple channels within them.
